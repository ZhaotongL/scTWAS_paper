1. "scTWAS_IRLS.R" is the main file to train GReX model for a gene with scTWAS.
2. "Compute_weight.sh" is a toy example on how to perform the Stage 1 GReX model training.
3. "gene.bed", "gene.bim", "gene.fam" are the PLINK bfiles of cis-SNPs of a gene.
4. "sct.rds" is a Seurat object generated by calling "SCTransform()" on a pseudo-bulk Seurat object.

"scTWAS_IRLS.R" will output a '.wgt.Rdat' file for each gene in each cell type similar to FUSION data format, which can then be used in Stage 2 testing following FUSION code.
